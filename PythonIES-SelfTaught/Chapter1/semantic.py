#Chapter 1 - Exercise 6
#semantic.py
#.py is a Python File

#Begin a new program by initializing a variable
#then try to output an expression using its value
#without explicit precedence
#the program should get the result of 28
num = 3
print(num * (8 + 4))

#Run it on the command prompt
#The semantic error cannot be seen by the commanc prompt
#to correct the semantic error
#simply add the parenthesis to the group expression 3 * (8 + 4)
#then run command prompt again and it should give you 36 as a result
